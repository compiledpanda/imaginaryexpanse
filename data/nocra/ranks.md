# Ranks
The lower down on the EM spectrum, the higher the rank. White is for recruits, and black is for special assignments.
Each rank also comes with a complete set of sub-ranks following the same pattern. Red/Red is followed by Red/Yellow, etc... There are 36 (6x6) official ranks in total.
Rank is displayed with the base (or first) color on the bottom, and the secondary color on top.

# Display
Nocra on active duty typically have their ears dyed with their rank insignia. Rank can also be worn on the collar or cuffs, but that is typically done by other species (or by Nocra who have lost their ears).

# Black Hand
When asked to serve as a black hand, the base rank (bottom color) is replaced with black. Black/White is for black hand trainees, Black/Black for base rank, etc...
